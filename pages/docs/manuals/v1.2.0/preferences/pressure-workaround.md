For devices where brush strokes are made before the tip of the pen touches the device surface, the input pressure on the Global Pressure Mapping preference can be adjusted to increase the minimum pressure required to make a stroke.

The Global Pressure Mapping preference can be accessed from the MyPaint Edit Menu:
  * _Edit â†’ Edit Preferences_.

To change the input pressure create a new node by clicking on the pressure line.

using the left mouse click on the new node and drag it down to the input line.

Note: It is recommended that this preference adjustment only be applied if your hardware makes it necessary. 
Changing this setting may affect how other users' brush collections work.
