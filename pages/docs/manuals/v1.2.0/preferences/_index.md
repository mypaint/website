Here you can see and restrict pointing devices to specific tasks on the canvas, or have them ignored completely if they glitch your drawing. Click on the text in the "Use for..." column to open a popup list. You can also limit an input device to non-painting tasks like moving or menu controls. This is especially helpful when you have a pen&touch-screen and you want to make sure the is no drawing with touch. The last column sets the behavior for a scrolling wheel, either zoom or move the canvas.

### Buttons

Set up button combinations with your pointer input device. In example, this can be configured to use your cursor as brush, colour picker and to navigate, depending on the control keys you press. Click the + button to add a new action, click the - button to remove the selected action. There are even actions that will open a brush or colour picker at your cursor location. Click on the text fields to edit an action or the modifier keys. Available modifier keys are:
* Ctrl
* Shift
* Alt

Plus one button of your pointing device - e.g. graphics pen tip, eraser and side buttons.

Here you can define keyboard shortcuts that don't involve the pointing device. You can use every key of your keyboard, except for the following keys) or combinations of keys:

- Esc, Enter, Backspace, Tab, Print Screen and the arrow keys

In the left you see all available actions, on the right are assigned shortcut keys. Click on a cell in the right column to edit the keys. A warning will be displayed if you choose a key (combination) that is already used by another action. 

All menu items can be used with a shortcut.
