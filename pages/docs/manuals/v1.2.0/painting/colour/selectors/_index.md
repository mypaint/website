MyPaint offers a variety of ways to choose and change colours. Besides the common digital HSV colour wheels there are three "intuitive" color mixers that are closer to analogue paint mixing: Crossed bowl, Liquid Wash, Concentric Rings. It is also possible to save and load colours in the [[Colour Palette|https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/wiki/v1.2-Palette]] (Shift+C). The Palette has further options that can be accessed with the top right wrench icon. The only other colour panel with additional options is the [[HCY wheel, which supports Gamut Masking|v1.2-HCY-Wheel-and-Gamut-Mask-Editor]].
