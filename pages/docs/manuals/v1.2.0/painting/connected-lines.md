Connected Lines behave similarly to the [[Lines and Curves|v1.2-Lines-and-Curves]] tool, except that the endpoint of one line is always the starting point of the next line segment. Only the last line segment you draw is active and can be manipulated with `Shift` into a curve. You can restrict line angles with `Ctrl` while drawing a line segment.

For more details about curve manipulation refer to the [[Lines and Curves|v1.2-Lines-and-Curves]] tool.
