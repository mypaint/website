When brush strokes are placed on the canvas, three elements determine the change made to the picture: The *painting
tool*, *brush*, and *paint mode*. These three elements can be combined arbitrarily to fit any desired art style.

1. **Painting Tool**: Determines the broad *geometry* of the stroke.
2. **Brush**: Determines the *design* of the stroke.
3. **Paint Mode**: Determines the *effect* of the stroke unto the canvas.


## Painting Tools
> *Menu → Edit → Current Tool*

Painting tools change how the user makes strokes by adding or removing contraints on stroke input.
