The Scratchpad panel is a versatile canvas space. For example you can...
* mix colors on it
* quickly paint, save and load sketches/studies
* display reference photos
* use it to save colour palettes
* even use it to save brushes (that can be picked with the Pick Stroke & Layer tool)
* share brushes and colours with coworkers for a big project
* ...

### Accessing the Scratchpad panel
* Click the Scratchpad icon in the [[UI Toolbar|v1.2-UI-Toolbar]]
* Main Menu _Window → Scratchpad panel_
* Main Menu _Scratchpad → Show Scratchpad panel_
* Keyboard shortcut `Shift+S`

### A canvas on the canvas
Basically the Scratchpad is doing nothing but displaying a second file. You can draw on and navigate the scratchpad like the normal canvas. The Scratchpad panel is equipped with functions to make it's usage comfortable and easy:
* **[+]** New scratchpad. The old one will be discarded without warning.
* **Open** a file as a scratch. There is a dedicated folder in the user settings, but you an choose a different location from your disk
* **Save** or export the scratch as file. Scratches will be auto saved to the user settings location. However there is only one autosave.ora. If you intend to keep a scratch it is recommended to save it under a new name.
* **Revert** the scratchpad to the last saved state.

### Additional options in the Scratchpad menu
Main Menu _Scratchpad_ offers more functions that are not available in the panel itself. You can change the Scratchpad's background and manage the default Scratchpad.
