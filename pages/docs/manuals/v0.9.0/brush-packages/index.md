This page collects extra brush packages for MyPaint. Feel free to add yours.

## Installing a Brush Package

![Import brush pack](ImportBrushPack001.png)

Download the ZIP file. Don't extract it. In MyPaint, open the *Brush* menu (or right-click
on the brush group labels). Choose *Import brush package* and select the ZIP file.

If a brush or group of the same name already exists, you will have the choice to
overwrite or import with a different name.

See [User Manual v0.9.0]({{< ref "../" >}}) for how to uninstall
or create a brush package.

useful. I thought that it would be fun to have something similar inside mypaint so i made them.
