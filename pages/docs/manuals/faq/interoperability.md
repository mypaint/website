There are three main ways of exchanging your work with other applications.
1. Exchange the working document, preserving all attributes like layers, etc.
    - For this we support the OpenRaster file format, which you can use with [several other applications][1].
2. Use v1.2.0's "Edit Layer in External App" feature.
    - This allows you to use an external program like GIMP or Inkscape to make changes
that would be difficult to achieve in MyPaint alone. Inkscape is particularly good
for captioning and text.
3. Exchange a pre-rendered image.
    - For this we support JPG and PNG like most other applications. Using PNG is
recommended as it is lossless, and very fast.
