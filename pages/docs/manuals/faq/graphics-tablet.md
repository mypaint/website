No. You can use a mouse or a touchpad, but a graphics tablet is very highly recommended
for drawing. Graphics tablets have much higher resolution than simpler input devices
no matter that the make.

The practical result of this is that you will get somewhat blocker lines if you
use a mouse when zoomed out a lot.

Try turning up the "slow position tracking" brush setting to compensate for this
if you see lots of straight lines at multiples of 45° and 90°.
