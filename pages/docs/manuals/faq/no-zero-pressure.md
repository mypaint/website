Sometimes a tablet might be sending false pressure data from the stylus: maybe the
sensor is constantly pressed a tiny amount, or there is a configuration glitch.
Sometimes it helps to replace the nib of the pen with a spare one. If this doesn't
work, you can fix this by adjusting the Global Pressure Mapping setting in Edit →
Settings.

- Adjust Global Pressure Mapping in Edit → Settings.
  - Click on the line to create a new node.
  - Move the node to the bottom of the coordinate system.
  - Move the node on the left-right (horizontal) axis while alternatively testing
your tablet on the canvas.

Tip: If you find it hard to find the right setting, you can get the pressure values
MyPaint (in version 0.9.0 and newer) sees by going to Help → Debug → Test Input
