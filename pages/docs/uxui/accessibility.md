This should be something to look further into. Let's get involved with the community
and see what they might need.

One of the big assumptions I feel that MyPaint makes is that visual art can only
be made by people who are not visually impaired, and so it doesn't try to make it
easier for people with such impairments to paint.

An assumption of dexterity is something else I would like to challenge. Surely there
are types of visual art that aren't underpinned by extremely dextrous hands.
