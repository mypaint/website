MyPaint's [human interface guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_guidelines)
sets out rules to help developers maintain consistency in the [user experience]({{< relref "../uxui" >}}).
Additionally, by providing these guidelines, developers have a point of reference
when justifying inconsistent design.

# Throwaway

at the cursor.
