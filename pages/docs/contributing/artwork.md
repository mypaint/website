# Icons
MyPaint's icons are primarily SVG symbolic icons, rendered at 16x16 pixels. For
certain uses such as the toolbar, we ask for 24x24 pixel versions too. Try to be
pixel-exact when designing icons, that way the icons will look good at the sizes
we need.

There is an Inkscape template for icon designers, and an extraction script in the
`svg` folder.
