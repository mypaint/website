MyPaint's [default brush collection][mypaint-brushes] is also external to MyPaint.

[mypaint-brushes]: https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint-brushes

mypaint-brushes package can be installed as a typical autotools build:

```console
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
# make install
```

# Using the brushes with pkg-config
If your application needs libmypaint 2.x brushes, you can make the
module "mypaint-brushes-2.0" a dependency with pkg-config.

For a C/C++ program, the CFlags generated by pkg-config will define the
macro MYPAINT_BRUSHES_DIR, usable in your code in order to get the path
for all mypaint default brushes.

For programs in other languages, you can use the variable `brushesdir`
to get the same information with pkg-config and insert this value in
your program in the relevant way.

> pkg-config --variable=brushesdir mypaint-brushes-2.0
