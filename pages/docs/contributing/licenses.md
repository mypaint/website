MyPaint is a [copyleft][wiki-copyleft], [open source][wiki-foss-def] project. Products
made by the MyPaint project may be considered a public good of sorts, and their
existence from a [legal perspective][wiki-ip] must be representative of this. The MyPaint project
actions this by distributing products under [open licenses][wiki-open-license]. As
a contributor to the project, you must agree to dedicate your work under specific
open licenses in order for us to be able to include it in our products.<!--more-->

# Users' Rights
- Users must have the right to freely license original works created using
an unmodified MyPaint painting application distributed by the MyPaint project.

# Types of Works
## Backgrounds and Palettes
> It is highly probable that background images and palette files will become embedded
in original works created using MyPaint.

To be included in the MyPaint project, backgrounds and palettes must must be [public domain][wiki-public-domain].
This may be accomplished using the the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal][CC-CC0]
dedication.

The declaration may appear in a README file, embedded in the image metadata or comments
fields. GIMP palette files have a description field which can be used for the same
purpose.

## Brush Packs
### Raw Brush Settings (\*.myb)
> Raw brush settings in a brush pack are copied around very enthusiastically by
the MyPaint program. It is highly probable that raw brush settings will become embedded
in original works created using MyPaint.

To be included in the MyPaint project, brush settings must be [public domain][wiki-public-domain].
This may be accomplished using the the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal][CC-CC0]
dedication.

### Other Files
Other files (files that do not follow the pattern "\*.myb") are not raw brush settings.
Such files include preview packages and supplemental cover-type artwork.

> Other files in a brush pack are self-contained, and should not become embedded
in original works created using MyPaint.

To be included in the MyPaint project, other files must be distributed [openly][wiki-open-license]
using one of the following dedications:
- Public domain deed ([Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal][CC-CC0])
    - You will still be credited unless you request otherwise.
- [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International][CC-BY]
- [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International][CC-BY-SA]

## Supplemental Artwork & Promotional Material
> Supplemental artwork and promotional material is content distributed by the MyPaint
project, but not *within* MyPaint.

To be included in the MyPaint project, supplemental artwork and promotional material
must be distributed using one of the following dedications:
- [Exclusive usage rights]({{< relref "#exclusive-usage-rights" >}})
- [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International][CC-BY]
- [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International][CC-BY-SA]

The declaration may appear in human-readable form on a website (such as GitHub or
the MyPaint community forums) alongside the work, or embedded into the work's metadata.

## Website (\*.md)
> .md files are used to populate the body of pages in the MyPaint website (https://mypaint.org)

To be included in the MyPaint website, .md files must be dedicated under the
[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International][CC-BY] license.

## Source Code
To be included in MyPaint, source code must be dedicated under the
[GNU General Public License, version 2 or any later version][GNU-GPLv2] license.
**Please note** that the "or any later version" clause is mandatory.

When working with source code:
- Retain the existing license boilerplates in source code files.
- Begin new files with a boilerplate header in the format recommended by
the license itself.
