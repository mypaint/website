Hi, my name is [Aesara](https://www.aesara.net). I develop MyPaint on and off. Currently the MyPaint project isn't being
developed full-time, but those of us who still work on it in our free time are greatly appreciative of the community's
financial contributions.

Money donated towards the MyPaint project will be used to maintain our infrastructure, and in time, used to pay
developers and key project staff. Thank you for believing in the vision of MyPaint.
