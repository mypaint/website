Intrest around the MyPaint project seems to have increased lately, both from end
users and contributors. I suspect this is both due to the software maturing and
getting more publicity (especially thanks to [David Revoy](http://davidrevoy.com)
of the [Durian project](http://durian.blender.org/)). We hope to see this trend continue!

In and before version 0.7 practially all development was done by project lead Martin
Renold alone. However, for the upcoming release I suspect that over half of the
commits/code changes comes from others. And this is not due to Martin slacking off!
Especially Ilya Portnov has done a lot of good work, but we also have significant
contributions from 4-5 others. Needless to say, this is awesome.

# MyPaint v0.8?
Here are some of the larger features/improvements that will be in the next release.
- Internationalization – you can now have MyPaint in your own language!
- Layer dialog – a graphical interface for manipulating layers
- Palette – with nifty features like autogeneration of colors/shades
- Improved brush dialog – with tagging/grouping to make it easier to 
navigate
- Revamped color selectors
- MyPaint in german

We are aiming to get this out in November/December, but…

##We want your help
Besides coders we want translators and people to write documentation. Don’t worry
if you don’t have a lot of experience, we will help you get started. We also want
packagers so we can get into official package repositories. And someone to help
get a Mac OSX version up and running (should not take much) would be great.

Interested? See the [Resources]({{< relref "/docs/contributing" >}}) on wiki site
for how to get in touch.
