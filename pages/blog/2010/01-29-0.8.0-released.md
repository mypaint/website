Finally we got MyPaint 0.8.0 released. There were many persons involved coding,
creating new brushes and translating. Thanks to everyone who has contributed!

My personal highlight are all the new brushes, nicely grouped and ready to be
discovered. This happened even though the number of changes in the brush engine
was near zero. Some brushes are even doing effects that I did not expect to be possible.

More on the GUI side, appart from brush grouping there now is a layer list and a
new color selector. You can also select brushes by pointing at a previous stroke
(press w), and there is a way to draw straight lines (hold shift). The user interface
has been translated into 14 languages.

It is also noteworthy that the performance when zoomed out was improved, and of
course there were many minor changes and bugfixes.

Personally I am excited about all the new contributions flowing in. But I hope I
will also find time to work on the brush engine again. The GUI did require so much
attention lately. Anyway, have fun with the new release!
