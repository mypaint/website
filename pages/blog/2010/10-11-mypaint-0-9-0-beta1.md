MyPaint 0.9.0 beta1 has now been released. This release has most of the new features,
changes and fixes that will be in MyPaint 0.9.0. A list of the improvements is unfortunately
not available at this time, so just check it out instead ;) The final relase will
be out in between 2 and 4 weeks time.

We are now in string freeze for MyPaint 0.9.0, which means that it is time to do
translations. We could always need more help with this, especially for supporting
new languages. In addition we are in need of people who would like to write documentation. 
If you want to help out, please [get in touch with us](http://mypaint.org/about/).
