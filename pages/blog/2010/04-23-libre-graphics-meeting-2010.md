Libre Graphics Meeting, or LGM for short, is a conference for users and developers
of free and open source graphics software. It brings together people from many projects,
including [Inkscape][Inkscape], [GIMP][GIMP], [Krita][Krita] and [Blender][Blender], 
and aims to foster collaboration and sharing of ideas.

This year, LGM is held in Brussels, Belgium between 27th and 30th of May. MyPaint
will be represented, for the first time, by at least project leader Martin Renold
and developer [Jon Nordby](http://www.jonnor.com/). Obvious highlights so far 
includes Martins proposed technical talk on [C/C++ extensions for Python][Cext]
and the planned [OpenRaster][ORA] [BoF][BoF] session. There will undoubtedly be
many other interesting things going on when so many great people with similar interests
come together.
