The new major release of MyPaint, version 0.9.0 is here! It has been 9 months since
the last major release now, so it was about time. Hopefully the next cycle will
be a bit shorter.

Here are some of the highlights in MyPaint 0.9.0.

# New features
Users can import and export brushes. This feature was developed mainly by [Ilya Portnov](http://iportnov.ru/).
Ilya also added tilt support to the brush engine.

One can now shows/hide all sub-windows with a key shortcut and there is a key for
showing the menu at the cursor. This work was done by [Andrew Chadwick](http://twitter.com/achadwick).
Andrew also tweaked window behavior and fixed a number of issues in input handling
and in the color sampler.

New preferences have been added; you can now set the default zoom level/resolution,
and the default save format. The color history popup bound to the secondary stylus
button can also be disabled.

We now save thumbnails for OpenRaster files according to the freedesktop.org specification
thanks to [Till Hartmann](http://tedil.deviantart.com/).

# User Interface
Open dialog now shows a preview supported files, also by Till Hartmann.

Saving and editing of brushes has moved together with the brush settings dialog,
which has been renamed to “Brush Editor” to reflect it’s intended use. The brush
selector has instead got the most commonly used brush settings in an expander, for
quick access during painting. The save dialog and exception dialog have gotten small
updates to improve usability.

There are no new translations but 10 languages have been updated.

# Performance
Performance has been greatly improved in two areas: startup and file saving. File-saving
optimization was done by Martin Renold, and should make MyPaint the fastest OpenRaster
implementation out there! The changes in how we save PNGs also make us require much
less memory when saving, which makes out-of-memory conditions less likely.

# Brushes
The default set of brushes has been changed slightly. There are now a maximum of
35 brushes in each group so that it is easier to view the entire group. There are
now three artists brush sets; “Deevad” by [David Revoy](http://www.davidrevoy.com/)
(of [Sintel](http://www.sintel.org/) fame), “Ramón” by [Ramón Miranda](http://ramonmirandavisualart.blogspot.com/)
and “Tanda” by [Marcelo Cerviño](http://blog.lodetanda.com.ar/) and two non-artist
brush groups; “classic” and “experimental”. The last two groups has gotten new
icons by David. In addition, pixel and tilt brushes have been added. The wiki has
[more Brush Packages](http://wiki.mypaint.info/Brush_Packages) for download.

There was also many other contributions, minor improvements and bugfixes that did
not make it into this post. Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release.
Enjoy!
