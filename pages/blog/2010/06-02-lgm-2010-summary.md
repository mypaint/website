Here is a short summary of MyPaint related things form [Libre Graphics Meeting 2010][lgm-2010].

The two most active MyPaint developers Martin Renold and [Jon Nordby] attended,
along with a number of MyPaint community members like "Popolon" and "Vlada". Also
attending was serveral users, including some that use MyPaint professionally like 
[Camille Bissue "Yagraph"][yagraph]. Sadly [David Revoy][revoy], professional MyPaint
user and concept artist on the [Durian Open Movie project][durian] was not able
to make it this year.

An [OpenRaster][ORA] 
birds-of-a-feather session was held. It drew a lot of people, both from free and
open source projects like [GIMP][GIMP], [Krita][Krita], [Inkscape][Inkscape], [Scribus][Scribus],
[ghostscript][ghostscript], and [Nathive][Nathive], but also prfessional standards
people from Adobe, Opera, and w3c attended, in addition to interested end-users. 
The topics were wide and mostly focused on long-term things, but consensus was
reached on a number of points regarding the standard and on the direction of the
format. This work will hopfully lead to a better experience for users of MyPaint
and the OpenRaster file format.

community members and artists!
