Hi, My name is Aesara, and I've been busy making the new website for MyPaint.

Development on MyPaint was started in 2004, making MyPaint just barely younger than
I am! To update the website and create a central source for information about MyPaint,
I had to trawl through documentation that hadn't been updated in years, alongside
decades old webpages on the Internet Archive, I had a ton of fun doing the latter.

In my journey, there were a number of interesting pages that sadly won't have a
dedicated space in the new website. So, why not create a blog post acknowledging
and preserving this information? This is it, you are here.

### Related resources
- [Ora Tools](http://gitorious.org/openraster/) (meaning OpenRaster tools) allows to open/save OpenRaster (MyPaint working fileformat) with Gimp. - The name "OraTools" has apparently been replaced with "OpenRaster", probably due to OraTools being an Oracle tool.
-   [Alternative keyboard mapping](Links-alt-keyboard.png) for use with keyboard and tablet sitting side by side. Tries to minimize left hand movement while painting (for right-handers and MyPaint 0.9+) [(get config file)](http://pastebin.com/EdNJUYWC).

## Other Control Methods
### Gestures
-   [easystroke](http://easystroke.wiki.sourceforge.net/)
-   [Tutorial for KDE's built-in gestures](http://kubuntuforums.net/forums/index.php?topic=3086781)

### Controllers
If you have a controller or other device that you can sit beside your tablet and use, then you can assign keyboard commands to it with a program such as [QJoyPad](http://qjoypad.sourceforge.net/) or [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/). This reduces desktop space use and can be helpful for those struggling to learn and/or quickly find normal keyboard shortcuts.
