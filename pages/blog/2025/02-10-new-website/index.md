Today we're launching an updated website for the MyPaint project. Aside from a fresh theme, the site incorporates our
user and developer documentation into a single source of truth. With the new website, all users can look forward to more
intuitive navigation of our documentation. Contributors will enjoy a more coherent and consistent workflow for modifying
documentation.<!--more-->

Currently, the "Documentation" section of the website may contain incomplete pages, but we're at a stage where the new
website supersedes pretty much everything in the old one.

In the early stages we keenly look forward to any feedback you may have. Thank you for helping us make the MyPaint
project the best that it can be.
