MyPaint is nearing its next stable release, v1.2.0, and that means it's time to
get the translations finalized. Today marks the start of a week-long translation
effort for MyPaint, and we need your help!

# Translation status
At the time of writing, the 33 languages we support are just under 50% translated.
We’d like that figure to be much higher! Can we get to 55% or 60% within a week,
or complete one or more of the smaller languages?

Latest figure: [{{< img src="https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/mypaint/-/svg-badge.svg"
title="Please help translate MyPaint into your language on Weblate" >}}](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/)

# How you can help
If you’re new to translating software, welcome! We've made it as simple as possible
to help. All of the program text is available for translation on [WebLate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/).
WebLate is a collaborative online tool that presents each fragment of text in turn,
and asks you to translate it. If you're not sure, you can type in suggestions for
other translators.

*(and please share the link with your friends!)*

You can log in with social media accounts, or your Github account if you are already
a developer. The account name is recorded in the commit log, and you can add your
name to the credits by adding it to the translation of the “translator-credits”
marker string.

# What needs translating?
MyPaint has two components which can be translated:
- [libmypaint](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/mypaint/libmypaint/):
    - This is MyPaint’s dynamic brush engine. The strings for translation are all
brush setings, inputs, etc.
  Without context, this can be somewhat hard to translate.
- [MyPaint](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/mypaint/mypaint/):
    - The main GUI for the program. Context is present for a subset of these, and
the strings don't require as much domain-specific knowledge. However, there are a
lot of them.

# Translation workflow
The main translation interface looks like this:

![Screengrab of the WebLate interface](weblate-interface-small.png)

1. Source texts in the program are written in US English.
2. The translation text box is where you write your translated text.
3. When you're confident the translation is correct, click on Save to move on to
the next string in the current list.

The **fuzzy** checkbox is an indication that this translation is a guess. Sometimes
this is because the tools we use have been forced to make an estimate about which
ild translation is which (it happens, sorry!) Alternatively, other translators may
have flagged the string as erroneous. Fuzzy strings are not presented in the user
interface, so reviewing and cleaning up fuzzy translations will really help a translation
present much more usefully.

One hidden feature in the WebLate UI is the **Machine Translation** tab. It's pictured
above, but it isn't open by default. Machine translation can be used as a starting
point, but please don't machine-translate the entire program!

You will sometimes see **formatting codes** in strings that need translating. These
might look like any of the following:
- `%s`, `%r`, `%d`, etc. (python-format)
- `{like_this}` (python-brace-format)

These need to stay in the translated text. The MyPaint program will try to replace
them with other fragments of text at runtime, for example the name of a file, or
a pixel size. If they are omitted, the program may crash or present the user with
an error message.

If you're an expert in MyPaint and want to help out other translators of your language
who don't know the program that well, please consider adding to its **glossary**.
This is also a good place to write up a style guide for your language's translation.

Even if your language is complete, you can help by sharing the link above among
your colleagues and friends on social media.
