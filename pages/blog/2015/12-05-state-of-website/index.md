As many of you may have read from [@mypaintapp][twitter] on twitter, our previous
host provider for both the mypaint website and the forums went dark a few weeks
ago. No one could get into the servers to at least backup what we lost. Instead
we decided to host mypaint on  github pages and use Jekyll to generate our site.
We have been working at recovering a lot missing data. The majority of data was
recovered thanks to [Andrew Chadwick] work with searching in Google cache files. 
[David Revoy] also had a backup of the previous website's theme. That good cause
we could utilized the image assets it has and incorporate them in the new one. We
almost have everything we need, but we still have a good ways to go before the site is ready.


The one thing we do need pretty soon is artwork for the new site. If any mypaint
user would like their artwork made in mypaint on dedicated our art gallery page,
please go our our [this issue thread][#8] in our github issue tracker. I will post
what we would need in order to use you artwork on that thread as well momentarily
after this is posted. Just keep in mind, it will probably need to be in a creative
commons licenses to be compatible with our site.

As stated above we also lost our forums as well. With no chance of recovering the
site, we had to rebuild that one as well. Luckily, we were able to get a sponsor
whom will upfront the cost to run a Discourse server on Digital Ocean. His name
[Noah Chelliah] who is a business owner of [Altispeed]. They're an Linux IT Solutions
company which specialize from home automation to network deployments. Noah is also
the co-host of Jupiter Broadcasting's Linux Action Show, so you may have heard of
him. I met him personally during [LinuxFest Northwest 2015][lfnw] last April and
he is an interesting guy to talk to. He is passionate about all things Linux and
he will do anything in his power to get you to switch. So we thank you Noah for 
your part in helping support the MyPaint Community.

There are still a lot of things that need done like gather information, page creation,
and designing the site in due time. Our goal is to at least have the website ready
and relaunched by the end of the year. With Discourse We should be ready sometime
next week so stay tuned for that. If you would like to help us with the website,
or our Discourse site, head over to its [issue tracker][issue] on Github. We appreciate 
all help even if it just mock-ups, suggestions or simple grammar corrections. We
also need help with getting the final push to translating both libmypaint and MyPaint
iself. For more information, please visit [this post][post] on our site.

From all of us at the MyPaint Community, Thank you.
