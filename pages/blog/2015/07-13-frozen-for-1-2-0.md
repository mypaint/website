Quick note to say that MyPaint is now frozen for the upcoming 1.2.0 release. Expect
announcements here about dates for specific betas, plus previews and screenshots
of new features; however the most current project status can be seen on our [Github milestones page](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/milestones).
