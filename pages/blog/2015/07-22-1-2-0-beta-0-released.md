Hello everyone. I’m really happy to announce the first proper pre-release of MyPaint
1.2.0 for those brave early-bird testers out there.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/releases/tag/v1.2.0-beta.0).

Windows and Ubuntu binaries are available, all signed, and the traditional signed
canonical source tarball is there too for good measure. Sorry about the size of
the Windows installers – we need to package all of GTK/GDK and Python on that platform too.

(Don’t forget: if you find the translations lacking for your languages, you can
help fix mistakes before the next beta over at [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mypaint/))
