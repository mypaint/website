Hi, I’m [David Revoy (Deevad)](http://www.davidrevoy.com/) and I’m new in the
maintener team of Mypaint’s website . I start a project to add more screenshots
to the “Screenshots” page of this website. So, If you are an artist or a user and
want to do a small contribution to Mypaint, I started a little campaign. You can
join and find more infos and guidelines on [my webpage][info].

All system, theme, type of art, skill, and artworks are accepted. For any question,
use the comment system on my blog , you can even ask anonymously.

Thanks in advance
