Just to tease a bit our Windows users about a good news: today [Tumagonx](https://github.com/tumagonx)
on our IRC channel (#mypaint, FreeNode) posted a screenshot of a recent build of
Mypaint running on a Windows operating system environment. This simply mean Mypaint
1.0 (coming soon) will also be available for this platform. Because we know many
users waited for it, we wanted to share the good news immediately. Be patient until
the future packaging and download available.

# Update: 6 November
For our Windows beta tester: Tumagonx packaged the ‘beta’ on [his webpage][beta].

[beta]: https://opensourcepack.blogspot.com/2009/08/mypaint-git-build-for-win32.html

Name on the list: mypaint-git-061111.7z [debug GTK dll, tablet fixed]

Help and [report your bug here](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/issues) using
this unstable version.
