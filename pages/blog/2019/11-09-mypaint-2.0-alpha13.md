For those who don't spend their days spamming `git fetch` in their local clone of
the mypaint repo, eagerly waiting for the latest changes, it might seem like nothing
much has happened recently. To allay such notions, there is now a new alpha release
with the latest and greatest changes (as a matter of fact, all changes) as we make
our steady crawl towards the beta phase.

Get yourself over to the [release page][release.src] for a list of changes and a
list of files!

Unfortunately we don't have the ppa or other deb builds up to date, so users on
Debian/Ubuntu will have to make do with the AppImage builds for the time being.

# A Tale of Alphas Past
Since there were no blog posts about the alpha releases after the first one, here
is a quick summary in reverse chronological order.

## Alpha 12
These were the new features added in alpha 12:
- Faster floodfill
- Offset/Blur options added to floodfill
- Gap-detecting floodfill
- Erase/Lock Alpha/Colorize now work with floodfill
- Click-drag floodfill (fill multiple separate areas in one go)
- Separate source-selection (you can fill _based on_ a specific layer)
- Cancellable floodfill (if you made a mistake on a _huge_ canvas or with a slow
computer, most people should never see the cancellation dialog)
- Adjustable opacity and blendmode for floodfill (sometimes useful)
- Ability to fill _with reference to_ vector layers.
- Viewport-limited floodfill (useful for erasing and adjusting gap-detection settings)

There may be a pattern in those additions, I'm not sure.

## Alpha 11
- Floating subwindows brought back on Windows
- Weighted subtractive smudging - using the spectral model for sampling colors

## Alpha 10-9
- Tweaks and fixes to rendering/compositing of the new color representations

## Alpha 8
- Keyboard-controlled drawing inputs for pressure and barrel rotation
- Improvements to layer merging for the new Pigment layer type

## Alpha 7-1
- Minor changes, preparations for barrel rotation input
