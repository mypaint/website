Today we're launching an updated website for the MyPaint project. Aside from a fresh
theme, the site incorporates our user and developer documentation into a single
source of truth. With the new website, all users can look forward to more intuitive
navigation of our documentation. Contributors will enjoy a more coherent and consistent
workflow for modifying documentation.

In the early stages we keenly look forward to any feedback you may have. Thank you
for helping us make the MyPaint project the best that it can be.
