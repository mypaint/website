The MyPaint brushlib(libmypaint) is now maintained in a separate git repository.
Its new home is also on [Gitorious][repo], so it hasn’t moved far! We’ve done this
because there are more projects using this code, or wanting to use it, than just
MyPaint. The MyPaint project now includes brushlib as a [git submodule][submodule].

[repo]: https://gitorious.org/mypaint/libmypaint/
[submodule]: http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules

The practical upshot of this for users is that you may see some unexpected errors
if you’ve been tracking MyPaint development through git for a long time. If you’ve
just updated your clone using “git pull”, and your build is failing due to a missing file:

    $ scons
    [...]
    In file included from lib/mypaintlib.hpp:13:0,
     from lib/mypaintlib_wrap.cpp:3071:
    lib/mapping.hpp:20:21: fatal error: mapping.h: No such file or directory
     #include "mapping.h"
     ^
    compilation terminated.
    scons: *** [lib/mypaintlib_wrap.os] Error 1
    scons: building terminated because of errors.
    $

then you may need to remove a local copy of brushlib that git has somewhat unhelpfully
left lying around. You will also need to tell git to pull in the submodules MyPaint
needs for building:

    $ rm -fr brushlib
    $ git submodule update --init
    Submodule path 'brushlib': checked out 'f9fd9[...]'
    $ scons

After fetching the missing dependencies, the build procedure should work as it did
before.

If you switch between branches a lot, you may find yourself having to do this quite
a lot: not every branch of MyPaint out there know about the submodule yet. Sorry
about that; please excuse the dust.

The basics of this are recapped in the updated [README file][readme], and more information
on working with git and submodules is available online or in print in the Pro Git
book, chapter [6.6 Git Tools – Submodules](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).
