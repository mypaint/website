Partly due to some issues with libmypaint that need to be sorted out, and partly
due to some unfortunate heavy snowfall, the release of MyPaint v2.0.0 is postponed
for 1-2 weeks.

Although unfortunate, this _does_ mean that our ardent translators have some more
time to get those final changes in, and maybe also add themselves to the list of
translators for their language. To do this, just edit the translation of the string
`translator-credits`. This string should contain a list of names and year(s), optionally
with an email address, like the following:

```
Justin Alias
Thomas Gobsmocker, 2016-2017
Marianne Outahere, <mario@localhosting.com>
Kim Perchhummer, 2018, <kp@centralhosting.com>
John Knowitall, 2019-2020
```
