MyPaint has been accepted into [Debian](https://www.debian.org/), ready for arty
Debianistas to test. This is great news for people using Ubuntu, Mint, or other
Debian-derived distributions too, because those distros pick packages from Debian
during their release cycles.

Progress: [http://packages.debian.org/mypaint](http://packages.debian.org/mypaint)

Looks like a keen Debian developer has picked it up for integration. That's very
welcome news for me at least, since I now don't need to find somebody with upload
rights and convince them to upload my packages. Better still, pieces of the the
debianization I've been maintaining for the Ubuntu PPA got incorporated into downstream,
just as I was hoping.
