MyPaint's brush engine, [libmypaint](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint), now
needs to be built with [autotools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System).
This reduces its dependencies on things like Python, which is good for projects
like GIMP which build against libmypaint. If you used to build MyPaint from git
with special _scons_ flags just to make libmypaint as a dependency for some other
project, you don't need to do that any more!

This is pretty much the final stage of making libmypaint a fully independent module.
To reflect its new status, we will be making formal releases of libmypaint shortly
for other projects to build with.

# Build/install
See the updated build documentation in [libmypaint's README](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint/blob/master/README.md).
It's all fairly standard stuff:
```
$ ./autogen.sh     # only needed when building from git
$ ./configure --prefix=/some/where
$ make distcheck
```

You can install it in the usual way too. However we will be making [Debian-style packages](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint.deb)
available via the PPA shortly, including developer ones. There is already a [git PKGBUILD](https://github.com/Alexpux/MINGW-packages/tree/master/mingw-w64-libmypaint-git)
for [Windows MSYS2](https://msys2.github.io/), and updates will be available shortly
for Arch Linux.

Development of MyPaint will continue of course; in fact making this split happen
has improved a lot of things in the codebases of both projects â˜º  Big thanks to
[@Jehan](https://github.com/Jehan) for making this all work so well!
