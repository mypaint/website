We have just released [libmypaint v1.3.0](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint/releases/tag/v1.3.0).
Libmypaint is MyPaint's brushstroke rendering code, in a form that can be used by
other programs. You can download signed source for the library from the project's
[github releases page](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint/releases), and a limited
number of binary packages maintained by us will be available shortly from other
places. See the release notes for details of other binaries, and please badger your
distribution's maintainers to get libmypaint included for their next release.

A big thank you to all our contributers, translators, porters, testers, and coders
for your work in preparing this release.

The master branch will soon be integrating lots of new brushy features for 1.4.x,
and will be breaking all sorts of things as a result. Watch this space â˜º
