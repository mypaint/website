We have a new prerelease out for you to test. When 1.2.1 is ready, it will be a
minor bugfix release. We're hoping to keep its beta cycle short, so please test
this prerelease if you can, and send us feedback.

Binaries are available right now for Ubuntu and Windows systems, and this prerelease
is available in official source tarball form too. MyPaint v1.2.1-beta.0 can be downloaded
from its [release page on github](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/releases/tag/v1.2.1-beta.0)
or from the [MyPaint-testing PPA](https://launchpad.net/~achadwick/+archive/ubuntu/mypaint-testing).
